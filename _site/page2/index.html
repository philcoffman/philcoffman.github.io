    <section class="post-content">
      <p>I have a love/hate relationship with blogging. I’ve shared about this before on previous blogs, but I used to be a more disciplined writer and thoroughly enjoyed blogging when I was in a publishing rhythm. I had an RSS reader churning through hundreds of feeds which was for all intents and purposes my daily newspaper. Fast-forward a few social network launches and the death of Google Reader and today I get most of my news from Twitter and a handful of sites I visit manually on a regular basis. Plus I’ve lost the discipline of blogging myself, mostly because in 2009 Twitter became my broadcasting medium.</p>

<p>Since then I’ve flirted with the idea of getting back into a blogging habit. I’ve made declarations of being “back in the game” before only to have things fizzle out. I’m fully aware that might happen again, but the only way I know how to aim for progress is to put one step forward and try to repeat that again and again. So here we are, another blog birthed and another initial post full of hope.</p>

<p>I’ve made a few key adjustments this time which I hope will aid in my discipline to blog regularly:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’m using a blog-centric platform called <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>. In the past I’ve tried other solutions which were decent, but weren’t as familiar to me as the days when I was running a Wordpress blog. I didn’t want to go the WP route this time because I wanted something simpler to set up and manage. My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/mds/status/595611830116077568">Matt Smith reminded me of Ghost</a>, so here I am. I still have <a href="http://philcoffman.com/">my portfolio site</a> online as well. Over time I may port the posts on that site over to this one.</li>
  <li>I’m trusting in the combination of RSS and Social Networks to help grow a readership. Since RSS isn’t as highly used as it used to be and many people get their site updates via social networks and friends, I’ve been skeptical whether anyone would find and/or read anything I published. <a href="https://twitter.com/philcoffman/status/595588841357979649">I asked on Twitter recently</a> how people follow popular blogs and the answers showed a mix of social networks, RSS, and friends. It’s clear that a combination of these things is key to promotion.</li>
  <li>I need and want to share more about the things I’m passionate about that are not design related. Years ago I wrote mostly about creativity, design, and inspiration and in turn I believe I grew in my discipline and understanding of this field. It’s not rocket science. The more you consider, reflect, and write the sharper you become about the subjects you cover. Or at the very least you help challenge yourself on what you believe and care about. Either way, you see growth. I want to get back in that habit and I challenge myself on a variety of issues. If I stick with this, then I expect my writing to be more candid and honest. This is good for me, as I often struggle with the belief that I can’t share something unless I have it all figured out. I want to break this. I want to be okay with being vulnerable in my writing. Hopefully that will cause me to grow as a person and in turn you’ll see more of who I am.</li>
</ul>

<p>So there you have it, another first post in the books. I have more already planned, some written, so there’s at least hope of a blog with at least two pages of posts. :) Onward.</p>

    <section class="post-content">
      <p>Something special happened in South Lake Tahoe this week. I boarded the plane bound for the west coast and <a href="http://epicurrence.com/">Epicurrence</a> early Sunday morning with anticipation and few expectations. I wasn’t sure what I was in for over the next few days. I had hopes for new experiences (I hadn’t skied since I was a kid, more to come on this), opportunities to meet some of my design heroes, and a desire to leave inspired to further my creative passions. Epicurrence fulfilled and exceeded those hopes.</p>

<p>I’ve attended a variety of conferences. SXSW, Brooklyn Beta, Circles Conference, SmashingConf, all of which have shaped and challenged me in individual ways. But recently I’ve grown a bit weary of the conference scene and I don’t think I’m alone. It seems several of my peers want to attend events which spark conversation and community rather than the focus being on a continuous knowledge dump, which can become exhausting. The two years I attended Brooklyn Beta showed me an event which successfully blended environments of learning and community. I have fond memories of traveling to Brooklyn and spending several days in person with online friends as well as returning home refreshed to pick up my work with renewed enthusiasm and inspiration. When I saw the announcement for Epicurrence I saw potential for this to be a similar style conference, so I jumped at the chance to attend.</p>

<p>Since starting at <a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/">PCPartPicker</a> I’ve been working from home, which has been an immense blessing to me and my family (a post all about that is in the works). But like a lot of other people who work remotely you have lonely days. I’m the only designer on the team so I highly value opportunities to converse with other designers in person. I’ve known <a href="http://twitter.com/dannpetty">Dann Petty</a> for a few years now, but had yet to have a chance to meet him in person. I was looking forward to that opportunity. The speakers he lined up are easily some of the best in the business. I’ve met <a href="http://twitter.com/hemeon">Marc</a> a few times before and it’s always a pleasure to spend time with that dude. His energy and pursuit in the game is infectious. <a href="http://twitter.com/yocline">Ben</a> is one of the co-founders of Rally Interactive which is one of today’s hottest studios. I’ve wanted to meet him ever since I <a href="http://methodandcraft.com/interviews/ben-cline">interviewed him</a> awhile back on Method &amp; Craft. <a href="http://twitter.com/schneidertobias">Tobias</a> can’t help but create some of the most beautiful work I’ve ever seen. I resonate with his love for product design. <a href="http://twitter.com/joshhemsley">Josh</a> was scheduled to speak, but had to cancel at the last minute. It was a shame because he’s incredibly talented and I would’ve loved to hear his perspective in the discussions we had. Thankfully a few audibles would called and other attendees were able to step up in his absence.</p>

<p>So on that Sunday, after arriving in Reno-Tahoe International Airport: “The Dumpiest Little Airport in the World” (slogan pending), I met up with Tobias, <a href="http://twitter.com/moore">Jonathan</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/alagoon">Anthony</a> and we made our way down to South Lake Tahoe. I live in Texas so mountains and snow are a novelty. Pulling into SLT we grabbed lunch, soaked up some sun on the top deck of the Heavenly Ski Resort California Side and then made our way down to the “Epic House”. Soon everyone else started to arrive and the first night of Epicurrence kicked off.</p>

<p>Every detail of Epicurrence was born from a heart of generosity. Dann went above and beyond to make us all feel welcome and ready for the next couple of days. For starters, our accommodations were…how do I put this…insane.</p>

<p>Located within walking distance of access to the slopes were two massive homes which housed the majority of our group. The Epic House was homebase for Epicurrence. We ate there. We had our discussions there. We <a href="http://meerkatapp.co/">Meerkatted</a> from there. The food was magnificent! Breakfast and dinner were prepared by a talented group of chefs and fridges were stocked with Blue Bottle coffee and <a href="https://munchery.com/">Munchery</a> meals. I had not heard of Munchery until this trip but I do hope they expand to Austin. The meals are exceptional.</p>

<p>Each attendee received a bag the first night, the contents of which were perfect compliments to the needs of the mountain. It didn’t stop there. <a href="http://www.boostedboards.com/">Boosted</a> provided several of their boards for us to enjoy and use a means of transportation between houses. <a href="https://www.zeel.com/">Zeel</a> met us with massages after hours shredding the mountain. <a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/">Western Digital</a> gave us a way to all go home with the photos taken during the event by <a href="http://studiocastillero.com/">Rico Castillero</a>. These are just some of the examples of how these companies contributed, but my sincere thanks goes out to all of the sponsors of Epicurrence: <a href="http://www.boostedboards.com/">Boosted</a>, <a href="https://www.zeel.com/">Zeel</a>, <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a>, <a href="https://thegrid.io/">The Grid</a>, <a href="https://munchery.com/">Munchery</a>, <a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/">Western Digital</a>, <a href="http://www.spyoptic.com/">Spy</a>, <a href="https://thegreatdiscontent.com/">The Great Discontent</a>, <a href="http://www.nixon.com/us/en/">Nixon</a>, <a href="http://topodesigns.com/">Topo Designs</a>, <a href="http://www.skiheavenly.com/">Heavenly</a>, <a href="http://www.patagonia.com/us/home">Patagonia</a>, <a href="http://gopro.com/">GoPro</a>, and <a href="http://polerstuff.com/">Poler</a>.</p>

<p>One of the reasons Dann created Epicurrence was to share his passions with his friends and peers, hence the location and time scheduled to head for the slopes of Heavenly. I hadn’t skied since I was a kid and I’ve never snowboarded. I opted to ski and after being told about two or three key things to remember I shredded up that bunny slope. I’m actually quite proud of the fact that I didn’t fall. In fact, the most dangerous time I had on the mountain was getting on the conveyor belt tunnel which took me up to the top of the beginner slope. “Lean forward” they tell you. I followed instructions but nearly ate it each time. I discovered, when others weren’t as luck as I was, that the conveyor belt comes to an instant stop when someone falls when getting on. This “safety” halt of the belt I’m sure helps the person who just fell, but also usually caused a few people already standing on the belt to topple over. I’m telling you, Black Diamonds are no match for the bunny slope conveyor belt tunnel.</p>

<p>Our time on the mountain gave everyone a chance to break off and bond over the thrill of the snowy slopes. I’ll admit that at first I thought our time on the mountain could be a distraction from the event, but it turned out to be a crucial component of the “family reunion” vibe of Epicurrence. By not being confined to chairs and presentations, we relaxed and laughed. Whatever hangups or egos may have been brought to Epicurrence were left on the mountain that first day.</p>

<p>But as epic as the snow, food, and gear were it was the people who made Epicurrence a truly special event. There were scheduled discussions on topics the current state of design, the future of agencies, <a href="https://thegrid.io/">The Grid</a>, and running studios and products. But since we ate, slept, and played together conversations continued at all hours, which meant there was plenty of time and opportunity for impromptu chats. What resulted was a raw candidness that I have never experienced at a conference before. Appropriately, we all understood that most of what was shared at Epicurrence stays at Epicurrence. Sure some of the info discussed we’re free to share, but there were often moments of vulnerable information which necessitates confidentiality. I loved this. In our open world of social sharing it’s hard to reach deeper levels of relationship, especially with people we know only through online channels. Epicurrence was only a few days long, but during that time we went deep and are better for it.</p>

<p>Here are a few of my favorite people moments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Meeting up with Tobias, Anthony and Jonathan on the first day, riding the bus down to South Lake Tahoe and soaking up sun on the top of the Heavenly Resort.</li>
  <li>Getting the chance to meet Dann Petty in person for the first time. Dude’s all heart.</li>
  <li>Rocking the bunny slopes with <a href="http://twitter.com/TheOlmstead">Stephen Olmstead</a> and then grabbing lunch on the mountain with <a href="https://twitter.com/thinmatt">Matt Spiel</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/erwinhines">Erwin Hines</a> where we talked about solving big content design challenges without sacrificing the aesthetic soul.</li>
  <li>Finally meeting <a href="https://twitter.com/gt">Geoff Teehan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jlax">Jon Lax</a> in person. Both of those guys are wicked smart.</li>
  <li>Seeing <a href="http://twitter.com/hemeon">Marc Hemeon</a> roll up in all white snow gear which reminded me of the time Gandalf appears on the top of the mountain and saves the day at Helms Deep. Henceforth I refer to Marc as “Hemeon the White”.</li>
  <li>Catching up with ex-Austinite <a href="https://twitter.com/soopa">Adam Michela</a> and hoping to pry some inside info on what he and the team are building at <a href="http://last.co/">Last</a>. Nope.</li>
  <li>Talking to <a href="https://twitter.com/tomkrcha">Tom Krcha</a> about software for designers and my experiences with Photoshop and Sketch.</li>
  <li>Getting to know <a href="https://twitter.com/rigelstpierre">Rigel St. Pierre</a> and watching him rock the facilitation of the scheduled talks and helped us know what was next and where we needed to be. He was absolutely crucial to Epicurrence’s success.</li>
  <li>Meeting and listening to <a href="http://twitter.com/yocline">Ben Cline</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ericatwell_">Eric Atwell</a> talk about Rally.</li>
  <li>Hanging out again with <a href="https://twitter.com/mds">Matt Smith</a>, who claimed the prize for best mountain injury.</li>
  <li>Camping out with <a href="https://twitter.com/connors">Connor Sears</a> in the theater room of “The Grid House” which had a fantastic collection of 70s and 80s movie posters. It also had a closet where the home’s alarm system lived and every time the house door opened we have a computer-aided voice tell us so…in all hours of the night.</li>
  <li>Meeting <a href="https://twitter.com/mcsheffrey">Connor McSheffrey</a> in the flesh, chatting about VSCO, but forgetting to tell him he’s one of my <a href="https://instagram.com/connor/">photography heroes</a>.</li>
  <li>Taking a brief ride in <a href="https://twitter.com/mjackson">Michael Jackson’s</a> Mustang GT and eating one of his wife’s amazing banana muffins, then later getting a sneak peek at a side product he’s working on.</li>
  <li>Listening to <a href="https://twitter.com/dburka">Daniel Burka</a> and Marc Hemeon talk about start-ups and product design stories. That conversation could’ve gone all night and no one would’ve complained.</li>
  <li>Trying not to be too much of a fanboy around <a href="https://twitter.com/tobygrubb">Toby Grubb</a>.</li>
  <li>Engaging in a serious discussion about jelly bean flavors with <a href="https://twitter.com/megdraws">Meg Robichaud</a>.</li>
  <li>Talking about Salt Lake City, creative communities, Burning Man, and life in general with Eric Atwell, Matt Spiel, Anthony Lagoon and <a href="https://twitter.com/balindsieber">Balind Sieber</a>.</li>
  <li>Sitting around the fire on the last night hearing ridiculous stories about dolphins, magic crystals, and elvis impersonators with the entire Epicurrence crew.</li>
  <li>Catching a ride back to the airport with <a href="https://twitter.com/charliecwaite">Charlie Waite</a>, Matt Spiel, and <a href="https://twitter.com/joselleho">Josie Ho</a> and then chatting even more with Josie when we found out we were on the same flight to LAX and had seats next to each other. Good chats about life, family, motivations, and work/life balance Josie!</li>
  <li>And everyone else who made Epicurrence an absolute blast: <a href="https://twitter.com/whoisnicka">Nick</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/aharmon">Anthony</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/elegantseagulls">Ben</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jwu1019">Jason</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/iamkgn">David</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/lat">Leigh</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/d4tocchini">Dan</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gregcorby">Greg</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/michaela_sf">Michaela</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/oswaldourrutia">Ozzy</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mattfaulk">Matt</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/karaplace">Kara</a>, <a href="https://dribbble.com/toneaikue">Anthony</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/areus">Aaron</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/joshaustin">Josh</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/bgalmar">Bob</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/lil_dill">Katie</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/teganmierle">Tegan</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>When a conference feels more like a reunion then it’s hard to say goodbye, but then the desire to come back together and do it all over again is that much stronger. Epicurrence Crew No. 1, you guys are alright and welcome in my part of the world anytime. Until next time!</p>

          Changing Things Up

    </section>
    <section class="post-content">
      <p>Today is my last day at <a href="https://gospacecraft.com/">SpaceCraft</a>. For the past year I’ve served as the VP of Design, helping support the company in a management and creative role. The entire experience has been great and it’s bittersweet to part ways. I owe a lot of my enjoyment this past year to the team, who are some of the brightest people I’ve ever worked with. That coupled with a product that continues to grow and mature at a rapid pace made my job a joy to leave home for.</p>

<p>But for several months I’ve had a desire to reclaim some of the time I spend away from my family, especially with my daily commute and the simple fact that I’ve worked my entire professional career remotely in an office. That’s normal for most of the population, but as our family expanded from two to four, for me, the desire to be more available to my wife and kids kept growing stronger and stronger. I knew I had to establish a new level of contentment with the fact that I have a family and also have a job, but I didn’t know what that was going to look like.</p>

<p>In June I had a conversation with a friend of mine who runs a website called <a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/">PCPartPicker</a>. His family and mine are at a similar life stage and I envied the fact that he worked from home and has a small team of people who also work from home in our area of Austin. He mentioned that he wanted to bring a designer on full-time and we met up to have coffee to chat about that. I wasn’t looking for a job change at the time, but he put his best sales hat on and soon had me considering the opportunity to join his team. The more I learned about his business, the team, the responsibilities of the design position, and the work culture I realized this could be viable. I still had questions, but we continued to meet and as those cleared up I found myself with an answer to the desires that had been building up inside me.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to leave SpaceCraft in a lurch, especially since we were in the middle of a big website redesign and product design updates, so I decided to hold off on transitioning out until the marketing site was done. The timing ended up working out nicely all around as I was able to not only help get the new site launched but leave the team with a design foundation for the entire platform. The work I’ve done for them in the past couple of months has been my best of the full year and I can’t wait to see the ideas get implemented.</p>

<p>I’m still invested in SpaceCraft, both as an ex-employee who poured a lot into the product, but also as a customer. This new site is running on SpaceCraft, which allows me to stay in touch with the team and see the product evolve. The roadmap is bright and I think their best years are ahead of them. I’m proud to have played a key part in establishing the design direction of the company and wish them nothing but the best!</p>

<p>So, PCPartPicker. What’s that all about, huh? Glad you asked, because I’m excited about it! PCPartPicker helps do-it-yourself computer builders browse components, check compatibility, and find the best prices. Their tools are awesome and the community is super strong. Philip and his team are a highly capable and focused bunch who work tirelessly to tweak and improve the site. They’ve gone to great lengths to ensure the data is accurate, the community is supported, and the site runs fast. One area they want to improve in is design and user-experience. That’s where I step in.</p>

<p>For the most part I’ll be doing at PCPartPicker what I’ve been doing at SpaceCraft, Element, and the companies before those. But one key difference here is I have the opportunity to dive head-first into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which is something I haven’t had the chance to do on a regular basis. We all know that these skills are requirements for web designers nowadays and I’m dying to grow them as much as I can.</p>

<p>Down deep I’m a big geek. I follow Apple news constantly, I still browse video game sites even though I don’t play them anymore, I stay up to date on tech trends, etc so to work on a site that is involved in the tech industry is exciting. I also like that I’m getting in early on a site that is taking off and being given the chance to help shape and direct it from a design perspective. And the culture at PCPartPicker is great. The team gets together regularly for lunch and in-person work sessions. They <a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/blog/46/more-than-building-computers">donate part of their earnings</a> to Charity:Water, which is fantastic and something I’m passionate about as well. They work hard to maintain a healthy work/life balance, which again is vital to me.</p>

<p>The job is going to require a lot out of me, no doubt, and working from home will bring its own set of challenges. But I’m ready to devote my design skills to it. I’m ready to grow in managing myself. I’m excited about the opportunities it creates for me and my family to have more time together. I’m hopeful. I’m ready to get started.</p>

          It's Not Enough
        </a>
      </h1>
    </section>
    <section class="post-content">
      <p>Music is a huge part of who I am. My parents taught me to appreciate it from an early age, my older brother got the musical ability genes and has been a big influence in the discovery of new artists. Music helps me get through my 45 min work commute and if I didn’t have my over-the-ear headphones and Apple Music then I’d be far less productive at work.</p>

<p>Melodies stir me. Lyrics move me. I love to sing and do so proudly in my car whilst drumming on the steering wheel, sometimes to the point of almost damaging my fingers. I’ll stay in the car and finish a song if I’ve arrived somewhere and the song’s not done. I’ll dance if no one’s looking.</p>

<p>And there are songs which stop me in my tracks, because they resonate with me on a very deep level. It could be the melodies alone, which are so beautifully considered and constructed that I am in awe at their artistry. But more often it’s the lyrics, which speak to me in a captivating way, even bringing me to tears. There are some songs I can barely finish without the eyes becoming misty and if I’m singing along, allowing myself to be fully connected with the artist, then I end up sobbing, my voice hoarse and breaking. For a long time I’ve wished to be able to play an instrument, to be up on stage performing, possibly singing. But aside from not having any training, I know I’d become a blubbering mess and have to end the show because I would inevitably connect with a song in a way which causes me to completely lose it. And nobody wants to go to that show.</p>

<p>“It’s Not Enough”, by <a href="http://www.dustinkensrue.com/">Dustin Kensrue</a>, is one of these songs. Some of you might know Dustin as the lead singer of Thrice, but in recent years he’s released a couple of solo albums which are just fantastic. His latest debut, “The Water &amp; The Blood”, came out of nowhere to me but has quickly become my favorite of his to date. Dustin has written songs in response to his faith and beliefs before, but this album is more direct in that regard, which turns some people off if they don’t share those same beliefs. But I do and it’s for this reason (along with my love for his voice and songwriting abilities), that I’m sharing this song with you.</p>

<p>The words in this song. The passion in how he delivers them. It’s a cry from his heart, one I can relate to. The desires of worldly power, recognition, pleasure. The emptiness of such pursuits. The realization that they do not and can not satisfy my soul. They’re not enough. I forget this all the time, but <a href="http://bible.com/59/ecc.2.9-11.esv">it is truth</a>. That’s why when this song comes on I want to sing along with the same intensity as much as I possibly can. It’s a declaration of truth to myself and to my <a href="https://bible.com/bible/59/rom.8.15.esv">Father</a>.</p>

<p>So here is the song and the lyrics. If you are inclined, play it and follow along with Dustin’s words.</p>

<h2 id="lyrics">Lyrics</h2>

<p>Though all the wealth of men was mine to squander<br />
And towers of ivory rose beneath my feet<br />
Were palaces of pleasure mine to wander<br />
The sum of it would leave me incomplete</p>

<p>Though every soul would hold my name in honor<br />
And truest love was always by my side<br />
My praises sung by grateful sons and daughters<br />
My soul would never still be satisfied</p>

<p>It’s not enough, it’s not enough<br />
I could walk the world forever<br />
Till my shoes were filled with blood<br />
It’s not enough, it’s not enough</p>

<p>Though I could live for all to lift them higher<br />
Or spend the centuries seeking light within<br />
Though I indulged my every dark desire<br />
Exhausting every avenue of sin</p>

<p>It’s not enough, it’s not enough<br />
I could walk the world forever<br />
Till my shoes were filled with blood<br />
It’s not enough, it’s not enough<br />
I could right all wrongs, or ravage<br />
Everything beneath the sun<br />
It’s not enough, it’s not enough</p>

<p>To make me whole<br />
It’s not enough, it never was<br />
Awake my soul<br />
It’s not enough, it never was</p>

<p>It’s not enough, it’s not enough<br />
I could walk the world forever<br />
Till my shoes were filled with blood<br />
It’s not enough, it’s not enough<br />
I could right all wrongs, or ravage<br />
Everything beneath the sun<br />
It’s not enough, it’s not enough<br />
Though all would bow to me<br />
Till I could drink my fill of fear and love<br />
It’s not enough, it’s not enough</p>
