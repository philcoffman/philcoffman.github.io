    <p>Music is a huge part of who I am. My parents taught me to appreciate it from an early age, my older brother got the musical ability genes and has been a big influence in the discovery of new artists. Music helps me get through my 45 min work commute and if I didn’t have my over-the-ear headphones and Apple Music then I’d be far less productive at work.</p>

<p>Melodies stir me. Lyrics move me. I love to sing and do so proudly in my car whilst drumming on the steering wheel, sometimes to the point of almost damaging my fingers. I’ll stay in the car and finish a song if I’ve arrived somewhere and the song’s not done. I’ll dance if no one’s looking.</p>

<p>And there are songs which stop me in my tracks, because they resonate with me on a very deep level. It could be the melodies alone, which are so beautifully considered and constructed that I am in awe at their artistry. But more often it’s the lyrics, which speak to me in a captivating way, even bringing me to tears. There are some songs I can barely finish without the eyes becoming misty and if I’m singing along, allowing myself to be fully connected with the artist, then I end up sobbing, my voice hoarse and breaking. For a long time I’ve wished to be able to play an instrument, to be up on stage performing, possibly singing. But aside from not having any training, I know I’d become a blubbering mess and have to end the show because I would inevitably connect with a song in a way which causes me to completely lose it. And nobody wants to go to that show.</p>

<p>“It’s Not Enough”, by <a href="http://www.dustinkensrue.com/">Dustin Kensrue</a>, is one of these songs. Some of you might know Dustin as the lead singer of Thrice, but in recent years he’s released a couple of solo albums which are just fantastic. His latest debut, “The Water &amp; The Blood”, came out of nowhere to me but has quickly become my favorite of his to date. Dustin has written songs in response to his faith and beliefs before, but this album is more direct in that regard, which turns some people off if they don’t share those same beliefs. But I do and it’s for this reason (along with my love for his voice and songwriting abilities), that I’m sharing this song with you.</p>

<p>The words in this song. The passion in how he delivers them. It’s a cry from his heart, one I can relate to. The desires of worldly power, recognition, pleasure. The emptiness of such pursuits. The realization that they do not and can not satisfy my soul. They’re not enough. I forget this all the time, but <a href="http://bible.com/59/ecc.2.9-11.esv">it is truth</a>. That’s why when this song comes on I want to sing along with the same intensity as much as I possibly can. It’s a declaration of truth to myself and to my <a href="https://bible.com/bible/59/rom.8.15.esv">Father</a>.</p>

<p>So here is the song and the lyrics. If you are inclined, play it and follow along with Dustin’s words.</p>

<h2 id="lyrics">Lyrics</h2>

<p>Though all the wealth of men was mine to squander<br />
And towers of ivory rose beneath my feet<br />
Were palaces of pleasure mine to wander<br />
The sum of it would leave me incomplete</p>

<p>Though every soul would hold my name in honor<br />
And truest love was always by my side<br />
My praises sung by grateful sons and daughters<br />
My soul would never still be satisfied</p>

<p>It’s not enough, it’s not enough<br />
I could walk the world forever<br />
Till my shoes were filled with blood<br />
It’s not enough, it’s not enough</p>

<p>Though I could live for all to lift them higher<br />
Or spend the centuries seeking light within<br />
Though I indulged my every dark desire<br />
Exhausting every avenue of sin</p>

<p>It’s not enough, it’s not enough<br />
I could walk the world forever<br />
Till my shoes were filled with blood<br />
It’s not enough, it’s not enough<br />
I could right all wrongs, or ravage<br />
Everything beneath the sun<br />
It’s not enough, it’s not enough</p>

<p>To make me whole<br />
It’s not enough, it never was<br />
Awake my soul<br />
It’s not enough, it never was</p>

<p>It’s not enough, it’s not enough<br />
I could walk the world forever<br />
Till my shoes were filled with blood<br />
It’s not enough, it’s not enough<br />
I could right all wrongs, or ravage<br />
Everything beneath the sun<br />
It’s not enough, it’s not enough<br />
Though all would bow to me<br />
Till I could drink my fill of fear and love<br />
It’s not enough, it’s not enough</p>
